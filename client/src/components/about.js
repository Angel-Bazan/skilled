        <p>
          Skilled is for any student in the OC area interested in any trade program. This project came into my mind since I used to work with students that want it do a career in the trade industry. Most of the students went to a trade school without knowing that most of their local community colleges offer these certicated programs. So this application has all the college names and info that have these Trades available to them.
          <br />
          <br />
        get info on your skill of interest!!
